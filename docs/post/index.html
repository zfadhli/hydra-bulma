          <p>The beginnings of digital marketing technology can be traced back to the 1980’s, when computers became sophisticated
            enough to store huge volumes of customer information. For a brief moment, no one knew what would happen in digital
            marketing, but by the 90’s it all became clear.</p>
          <img src="../img/post-1.jpg" alt="" class="image">
          <p>It is implied that the selling process will proceed fairly and ethically so that the parties end up nearly equally
            rewarded. The stages of selling, and buying, involve getting acquainted, assessing each party’s need for the
            other’s item of value, and determining if the values to be exchanged are equivalent or nearly so, or, in buyer’s
            terms, “worth the price.” Sometimes, sellers have to use their own experiences when selling products with appropriate
            discounts.</p>
          <h3>Management point of view</h3>
          <p>From a management viewpoint it is thought of as a part of marketing, although the skills required are different.
            Sales often forms a separate grouping in a corporate structure, employing separate specialist operatives known
            as salespersons (singular: salesperson). Selling is considered by many to be a sort of persuading “art”. Contrary
            to popular belief, the methodological approach of selling refers to a systematic process of repetitive and measurable
            milestones, by which a salesman relates his or her offering of a product or service in return enabling the buyer
            to achieve their goal in an economic way. While the sales process refers to a systematic process of repetitive
            and measurable milestones, the definition of the selling is somewhat ambiguous due to the close nature of advertising,
            promotion, public relations, and direct marketing.</p>
          <img src="../img/post-2.jpg" alt="" class="image">
          <p>Selling is the profession-wide term, much like marketing defines a profession. Recently, attempts have been made
            to clearly understand who is in the sales profession, and who is not. There are many articles looking at marketing,
            advertising, promotions, and even public relations as ways to create a unique transaction.</p>
          <h3>Common terms</h3>
          <p>Two common terms used to describe a salesperson are “Farmer” and “Hunter”. The reality is that most professional
            sales people have a little of both. A hunter is often associated with aggressive personalities who use aggressive
            sales technique. In terms of sales methodology a hunter refers to a person whose focus is on bringing in and
            closing deals. This process is called “sales capturing”. An example is a commodity sale such as a long distance
            sales person, shoe sales person and to a degree a car sales person. Their job is to find and convert buyers.
            A sales farmer is someone who creates sales demand by activities that directly influence and alter the buying
            process.</p>
